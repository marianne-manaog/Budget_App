# Budget_App
This repository illustrates a simple budget application in Python. 

This repository has the following two files:
- **budget.py**, which has the class "Budget", whose attributes are balance, category and ledger, and two associated methods ("deposit", "withdraw")
- **app.py**, which runs budget.py to enable the developer to perform one or more transactions to deposit and/or withdraw an amount for a specific budget category.
