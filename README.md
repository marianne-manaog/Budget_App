# Budget App
This repository illustrates a simple budget application in Python. 

This repository has the following two files:
- **[budget.py](https://github.com/marianne-manaog/Budget_App/blob/main/budget.py)**, which has the class "Budget", whose attributes are balance, category and ledger, and two associated methods ("deposit", "withdraw")
- **[app.py](https://github.com/marianne-manaog/Budget_App/blob/main/app.py)**, which runs budget.py to enable the developer to perform one or more transactions to deposit and/or withdraw an amount for a specific budget category.
